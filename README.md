> **Notes Reimagined: Capture, Question, Master**

A next-generation AI-powered note-taking application that transforms learning through intelligent questioning, spaced repetition, ai-review sessions and advanced editing capabilities.

> I am a serious web developer, so you can easily find demo on my localhost. I mean, literally: www.mylocalhost.at

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with optimized queries
- **Editor**: Lexical with custom plugins
- **Authentication**: Custom auth with email confirmation and OAuth (Google, GitHub)

## Design Patterns

The application architecture leverages several key design patterns to ensure separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability.

### Service Layer

A core concept is the use of a **Service Layer** to abstract external integrations and complex business logic. This is evident in the `services/` directory:

-   `DatabaseService`: Encapsulates all direct interactions with the PostgreSQL database. It exposes a clean API for data manipulation (`CRUD` operations) and complex queries, decoupling the main application logic from the database implementation. This makes it easier to manage migrations, optimize queries, and potentially switch database providers in the future.
-   `AIService`: Manages all communication with the AI provider (e.g., Google Gemini). It handles API requests for features like question generation, content summarization, and evaluation. This isolates AI-specific logic, allowing for different AI models or providers to be integrated without altering the core application code.
-   `EmailService`: Handles sending transactional emails for features like email verification and notifications.

This pattern promotes the **Single Responsibility Principle**, where each service has a distinct and focused purpose.

### State Management

The application employs a hybrid state management strategy:

-   **Zustand (Client-Side State)**: For managing global UI state, such as user preferences, UI toggles, and session information. Zustand's minimalist API and hook-based approach provide a lightweight and efficient way to handle state that is shared across many components.
-   **React Context (Scoped State)**: Used for providing state within specific component sub-trees, such as the state of the Lexical editor or the current theme.
-   **Virtual State & Optimistic UI**: The application creates a "virtual state" on the client to provide an immediate and responsive user experience. When a user performs an action (e.g., creating a note), the UI is updated instantly ("optimistically") while the actual server request happens in the background. This reduces perceived latency and makes the application feel faster. Server calls are minimized to only what is essential, reducing network overhead.

### Architectural Patterns

-   **Next.js App Router**: The file-based routing and component structure (`app/` directory) follows modern Next.js conventions, enabling features like server components, layouts, and API routes for a clear and organized project structure.
-   **Modular Structure**: The codebase is organized into distinct modules by feature or responsibility (e.g., `components/`, `lib/`, `services/`, `types/`). This modularity makes the codebase easier to navigate, understand, and maintain as it grows.
